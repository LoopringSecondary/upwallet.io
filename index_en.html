                        <p>UP is built upon the underlying open-source code of the Loopring protocol.  We invite any individual or organization to review the code to verify that our private key management is, in fact, rigorous and risk-free.

                        <h4>Will UP backup my private keys on their server?</h4>
                        <p>No, UP is strictly a decentralized wallet. Our principle is that the user's private keys should remain only in the wallet, with no exposure to the network, including the backend servers. Users are solely responsible for the backup of their private keys!

Whenever your friends place orders using their new wallets, your share of the fees will be transferred via the Loopring protocol directly to an address held within your wallet. The more friends you refer to UP, the more you earn.</p>
